# ðŸ¦ˆ Soro-Shark

Soro-Shark empowers users to tokenize their equity on the Stellar Network using Soroban. These tokens serve as a digital representation of ownership in a company, and their value is intrinsically linked to the company's overall valuation.

In today's market, a plethora of tokens and NFTs offer little to no real value, often being little more than gimmicks. Soro-Shark's mission is to transform tokens into a genuine reflection of ownership in tangible assets that can appreciate in the real world.

By embracing decentralization, Soro-Shark paves the way for globalization and democratization while bypassing the often cumbersome paperwork process. This ensures that security is never compromised.
